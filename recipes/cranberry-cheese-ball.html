    <h2>Description:</h2>
    Yummy scrumptious cheeseball covered in cranberries and other stuff (I don't know
    what else yet, I haven't read the recipes yet). 
    <p>SO ANYWAYS, let's just jump into the recipe itself:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup cranberry juice cocktail</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dried cranberries, snipped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon orange zest</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pecans, toasted and finely chopped</li>
        <li>crackers, crostini, and/or vegetable dippers for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Bring cranberry juice just to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat. 
            Add 1/4 cup dried cranberries. Cover; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and butter in a large bowl. Let stand at 
            room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain cranberries, reserving 1 tablespoon juice. Add plumped cranberries and 
            reserved juice to the bowl with the cheese mixture. Add 1 tablespoon chives, 
            orange zest, brown sugar, and garlic powder. Beat with an electric mixer on 
            medium until light and fluffy. </li>
        <li>Place cheese mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap. Use the plastic wrap to shape
             the mixture into a ball (it wonâ€™t be a perfect shape at this point). Wrap in 
             the plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 3 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Now you can make a better ball shape by rolling the wrapped mixture on your 
            work surface.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup dried cranberries, remaining 1 tablespoon chives, 
            and the pecans on a sheet of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Roll cheese ball in 
            the mixture to coat.</li>
        <li>Let stand 15 minutes before serving with crackers, crostini, or vegetable dippers.</li>
    </ol>
