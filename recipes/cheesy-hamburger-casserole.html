    More cheesy stuff! This time its a delicious hamburger in casserole format... what else could you want! 
    <p>SO ANYWAYS, let's just jump into the recipe itself:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir 
            until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup, 
            tomatoes, and uncooked rice. Cover, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, 
            until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the contents of
